# Community_Support_Tracker

- This tool will help us monitor and manage our various community support initiatives, ensuring we're making a meaningful impact.

- The Community Support Tracker will have three main components:

1. Donation Tracker
2. Volunteer Hours Tracker
3. Event Signup

- Each of these components will be designed and built by our talented developers, who are eager to make a difference in their communities.

# Donation Tracker

- The Donation Tracker helps PiXELL River Financial keep track of donations. Users can add how much they gave, which charity, when, and any notes. It shows the total donations so the company can see and share how theyâ€™re helping.

# Volunteer Hours Tracker

- The Volunteer Hours Tracker helps PiXELL River Financial track employee volunteer hours. Employees can log how much time they volunteered, where they helped, and what they did. It adds up all the hours so the company can see how much volunteer work is done and give employees credit.

# Event Signup

- The Event Signup helps PiXELL River Financial sign up for community events. It makes it easy to join events like galas, cleanups, or food drives and keeps track of what the company will do. This helps make sure PiXELL River Financial is part of the events.
